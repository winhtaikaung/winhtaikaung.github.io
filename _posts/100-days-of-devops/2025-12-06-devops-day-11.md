The Nautilus application development team recently finished the beta version of one of their Java-based applications, which they are planning to deploy on one of the app servers in Stratos DC. After an internal team meeting, they have decided to use the tomcat application server. Based on the requirements mentioned below complete the task:



a. Install tomcat server on App Server 1.

b. Configure it to run on port 3000.

c. There is a ROOT.war file on Jump host at location /tmp.


Deploy it on this tomcat server and make sure the webpage works directly on base URL i.e curl http://stapp01:3000

## Configuring Tomcat
 sudo yum install tomcat -y
##  Start the service
 sudo systemctl start tomcat.service

## Configuring the tomcat server
**ps**: Because of tomcat was installed using package manager so the default server config path is as follow
`/usr/share/tomcat/conf/server.xml`

Change this to 
```xml
    <Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
               connectionTimeout="20000"
               redirectPort="8443"
               maxParameterCount="1000"
               />
```

This
```xml
    <Connector port="3000" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
               connectionTimeout="20000"
               redirectPort="8443"
               maxParameterCount="1000"
               />
```

## Verification
````bash
[tony@stapp01 tomcat]$ curl http://stapp01:3000
