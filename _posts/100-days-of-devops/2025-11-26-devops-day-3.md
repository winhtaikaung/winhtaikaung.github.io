## Day 3
So the requirement is to disble root login via ssh on all 3 app servers.

in order to change the ssh config in linux, there is a file called `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` which may need to access via root

So we edit that file 

`sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config`

the search for `PermitRootLogin yes`

change it `PermitRootLogin no`

Save it (using :wq)

### Verification

Then restart the ssh server since it is managed by `systemd` 

`sudo systemctl restart sshd.service`

just in case if you make some mistake in sshd_config you may check your service status using 

`sudo systemctl status sshd.service`

Thats all of today ! Thx Bye
