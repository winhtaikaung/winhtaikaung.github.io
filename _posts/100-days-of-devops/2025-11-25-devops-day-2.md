## Day 2

### Create Temporary User with Expirary Date 

Its always good to review linux fundamentals even though I have been using linux for a while. 

so the requirement is to create a user with expirary Date. 

First I was about to google as usual , but I don't want to google it. 
So `--help` is my friend . 

```
useradd --help
Usage: useradd [options] LOGIN
       useradd -D
       useradd -D [options]

Options:
      --badname                 do not check for bad names
  -b, --base-dir BASE_DIR       base directory for the home directory of the
                                new account
      --btrfs-subvolume-home    use BTRFS subvolume for home directory
  -c, --comment COMMENT         GECOS field of the new account
  -d, --home-dir HOME_DIR       home directory of the new account
  -D, --defaults                print or change default useradd configuration
  -e, --expiredate EXPIRE_DATE  expiration date of the new account
  -f, --inactive INACTIVE       password inactivity period of the new account
  -F, --add-subids-for-system   add entries to sub[ud]id even when adding a system user
  -g, --gid GROUP               name or ID of the primary group of the new
                                account
  -G, --groups GROUPS           list of supplementary groups of the new
                                account
  -h, --help                    display this help message and exit
  -k, --skel SKEL_DIR           use this alternative skeleton directory
  -K, --key KEY=VALUE           override /etc/login.defs defaults
  -l, --no-log-init             do not add the user to the lastlog and
                                faillog databases
  -m, --create-home             create the user's home directory
  -M, --no-create-home          do not create the user's home directory
  -N, --no-user-group           do not create a group with the same name as
                                the user
  -o, --non-unique              allow to create users with duplicate
                                (non-unique) UID
  -p, --password PASSWORD       encrypted password of the new account
  -r, --system                  create a system account
  -R, --root CHROOT_DIR         directory to chroot into
  -P, --prefix PREFIX_DIR       prefix directory where are located the /etc/* files
  -s, --shell SHELL             login shell of the new account
  -u, --uid UID                 user ID of the new account
  -U, --user-group              create a group with the same name as the user
  -Z, --selinux-user SEUSER     use a specific SEUSER for the SELinux user mapping
      --extrausers              Use the extra users database
```

As I saw we can set the expirary date for user which is that I need for my task , no brainer I just copy as they requested and replace placeholder,by default user management usually need sudo permission. So the command has to start with sudo first.

```
sudo useradd --expiredate YYYY-MM-DD -m username
```

Thats all for today.
