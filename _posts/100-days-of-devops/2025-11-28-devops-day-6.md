The Requirement is as follow

The Nautilus system admins team has prepared scripts to automate several day-to-day tasks. They want them to be deployed on all app servers in Stratos DC on a set schedule. Before that they need to test similar functionality with a sample cron job. Therefore, perform the steps below:



a. Install cronie package on all Nautilus app servers and start crond service.


b. Add a cron */5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text for root user.

## Install the Cron Job
As always we search the package 
make sure you have root access in order to make changes

```bash

[root@stapp01 ~]# yum search cronie
Last metadata expiration check: 92 days, 17:09:16 ago on Fri Aug 29 04:52:17 2025.
============================= Name Exactly Matched: cronie ==============================
cronie.x86_64 : Cron daemon for executing programs at set times
================================= Name Matched: cronie ==================================
cronie-anacron.x86_64 : Utility for running regular jobs
cronie-noanacron.x86_64 : Utility for running simple regular jobs in old cron style

```


## Check the Cron service

```bash
[root@stapp01 ~]# systemctl status crond.service
```

## Edit the Cron 

Again help is always my go to option for me because we may forget the command , some how crontab does not complaint even if I type `--help` . I just want to see existing cron jobs if any and edit the cronttab.

```
[root@stapp01 ~]# crontab --help
crontab: invalid option -- '-'
crontab: usage error: unrecognized option
Usage:
 crontab [options] file
 crontab [options]
 crontab -n [hostname]

Options:
 -u <user>  define user
 -e         edit user's crontab
 -l         list user's crontab
 -r         delete user's crontab
 -i         prompt before deleting
 -n <host>  set host in cluster to run users' crontabs
 -c         get host in cluster to run users' crontabs
 -T <file>  test a crontab file syntax
 -s         selinux context
 -V         print version and exit
 -x <mask>  enable debugging

Default operation is replace, per 1003.2
```
## List existing crontab
You can use `crontab -l` for listing cronjobs.
apparently there is no jobs for rootuser
```
[root@stapp01 ~]# crontab -l
no crontab for root
```
### Editing the cronjob
You can edit edit using vi or using direct std out write to ` /var/spool/cron/yourusername` because cronjobs can be configured for different users.

**Editing using crontab -e**
```
crontab -e
```
**Direct Std out to crontab file**

```
echo "*/5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text" >> /var/spool/cron/root
```

for more cron expression you may check your friend manual `
`man 5 crontab`

after editing you may restart the cron service. 

```bash
systemctl status crond.service
```

### Wait for 5 mins
Then check the file was written after 5 mins
```
[root@stapp01 ~]# cat /tmp/cron_text
hello
```



Thats all of today , Thx Bye !
