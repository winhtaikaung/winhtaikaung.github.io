The production support team of xFusionCorp Industries has deployed some of the latest monitoring tools to keep an eye on every service, application, etc. running on the systems. One of the monitoring systems reported about Apache service unavailability on one of the app servers in Stratos DC.



Identify the faulty app host and fix the issue. Make sure Apache service is up and running on all app hosts. They might not have hosted any code yet on these servers, so you don’t need to worry if Apache isn’t serving any pages. Just make sure the service is up and running. Also, make sure Apache is running on port 8083 on all app servers.

## Debugging Traces
Since we know the port , we scan the individual port is opened by using `telnet`

Apparently in the below logs `stapp01` is refusing the connection

```bash
thor@jumphost ~$ telnet stapp01 8083
Trying 172.16.238.10...
telnet: connect to address 172.16.238.10: Connection refused
thor@jumphost ~$ telnet stapp02 8083
Trying 172.16.238.11...
Connected to stapp02.
Escape character is '^]'.
^C^]
telnet> ^CConnection closed.
thor@jumphost ~$ telnet stapp03 8083
Trying 172.16.238.12...
Connected to stapp03.
Escape character is '^]'.
^]
telnet> Connection closed.
```

So we get into the server and try to find out whats going on. So we did a quick check using 
```bash
[tony@stapp01 ~]$ systemctl status httpd.service -l 
```
then we found out that we got port binding issue since the port was allocated by some process. 

## Who is allocating Apache Port
Its time to find who is allocating the apache port using netstat.

```bash
[tony@stapp01 ~]$ sudo  netstat -tulnpa | grep ":8083"
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:8083          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      778/sendmail: accep 
```

## Resolution
Then we found out sendmail is using the port that we are looking for at PDI 778

Then we kill the process and restart the http.service 

Check the service 
```bash
[tony@stapp01 ~]$ systemctl status httpd.service -l

## Verification
redo the telnet check on same port with same server then it is connected . 

```bash
thor@jumphost ~$ telnet stapp01 8083
Trying 172.16.238.10...
Connected to stapp01.
Escape character is '^]'.
```

Thats all for today , Thx Bye !
